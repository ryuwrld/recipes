        <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water, lukewarm</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Toppings</h4>
    <ul class="topping-list">
        <li>mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>marinara sauce</li>
        <li>beef pepperoni</li>
        <li>jalapeños</li>
        <li>burrata</li>
        <li>hot honey</li>
        <li>grated parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li>To a large mixing bowl, add the bread flour, salt, instant yeast, lukewarm water, sugar, and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bring the dough together using a hook attachment on a stand mixer or use a wooden spoon/rubber spatula. You can also knead it by hand. Knead together for about 2 to 3 minutes until you have a soft and elastic dough. It should be a bit sticky but not difficult to handle. If it is too sticky, add a tablespoon of flour.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover, and let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>To a 9x13 deep baking pan, add 2 tablespoons olive oil and grease the bottom and sides well. </li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the pan and start to stretch it out from the inside to the edges until you have a large rectangular dough that fills up the pan.</li>
        <li>Cover again and let it rest in a warm place for about 1 hour, until risen.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 525°F. You want the oven to be very hot by the time the pizza goes in.</li>
        <li>To a small bowl, add the melted butter, parsley, garlic, parmesan, salt, black pepper, oregano, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Once the dough rises, brush with the garlic butter.</li>
        <li>Add pizza sauce on top, then mozzarella cheese, and toppings of choice. Make sure to add cheese along the crust as well so it crisps up on the edges for that signature Detroit style.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the oven and bake for about 12 to 14 minutes or until the edges and bottom is golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Take out of the oven and slice into squares to enjoy!</li>
